# lavaKirbyHatManager
A program to help simplify the process of setting up Kirby Hats for EX Characters in Project+Ex builds, based on [DesiacX's EX Kirby Hat Quick Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17B462eugiS45PcSsie1iIr8gDl-bQM-gjIT17TIfl6Q/).

Note that this program currently only performs Steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the linked guide; it automatically performs the steps outlined there and nothing else. As a result, you'll still need to manually perform the rest of the process outlined there.
Importantly, that means you'll still need to manually edit to your characters' "FighterXX.dat" files, copy and rename your source character's hat files, edit "Source/ProjectM/CloneEngine.asm" (if you're working with a Lucario or Samus hat), and compile your GCTs with GCTRM yourself. See included "readme.txt" for more specific use instructions.

***Important Note:*** *Kirby Hat compatibility is still* ***extremely*** *spotty, most source characters simply don't work. While this may change as fixes are developed for other hats, things are (and will remain) remarkably limited for the time being.*
