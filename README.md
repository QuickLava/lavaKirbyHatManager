# lavaKirbyHatManager
A program to help simplify the process of setting up Kirby Hats for EX Characters in Project+Ex builds, based on [DesiacX's EX Kirby Hat Quick Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17B462eugiS45PcSsie1iIr8gDl-bQM-gjIT17TIfl6Q/).

Note that this program currently only performs Steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the linked guide; it automatically performs the steps outlined there and nothing else. As a result, you'll still need to manually perform the rest of the process outlined there.
Importantly, that means you'll still need to manually edit to your characters' "FighterXX.dat" files, copy and rename your source character's hat files, edit "Source/ProjectM/CloneEngine.asm" (if you're working with a Lucario or Samus hat), and compile your GCTs with GCTRM yourself.

***DISCLAIMER***: *Kirby hat compatibility is currently* ***very*** *spotty; most characters' hats do not currently work. This is a technological limitation, though it's possible that compatibility will improve with future developments in the scene.*
