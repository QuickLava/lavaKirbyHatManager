# lavaKirbyHatManager
A program to help simplify the process of setting up Kirby Hats for EX Characters in Project+Ex builds, based on [DesiacX's EX Kirby Hat Quick Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17B462eugiS45PcSsie1iIr8gDl-bQM-gjIT17TIfl6Q/).

Note that this program currently only performs Steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the linked guide, and that's about it. As a result, you'll still need to manually perform any other steps involved in the process of getting your hats up and running.
Importantly, that means you'll still need to manually edit your characters' "FighterXX.dat" files, copy and rename your source character's hat files, edit "Source/ProjectM/CloneEngine.asm" (if you're working with a Lucario or Samus hat), and compile your GCTs with GCTRM yourself. See included "readme.txt" for more specific use instructions.

***Important Note:*** *Kirby Hat compatibility is still* ***extremely*** *spotty, most source characters simply don't work. While this may change as fixes are developed for other hats, things are (and will remain) remarkably limited for the time being.*

*For preliminary compatability information, see [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rlw8wemQ849w-6AgGISXATPv6-pfVnTTQcQqd6N-crI/edit?usp=sharing).*
