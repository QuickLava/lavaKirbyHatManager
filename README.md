# lavaKirbyHatManager
A program to help simplify the process of setting up Kirby Hats for EX Characters in Project+Ex builds, based on [DesiacX's EX Kirby Hat Quick Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17B462eugiS45PcSsie1iIr8gDl-bQM-gjIT17TIfl6Q/).

Note that this program currently only performs Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the linked guide: it simply automatically performs the steps outlined there. As a result, you'll still need to manually perform the rest of the process outlined there.
Importantly, that means you'll still need to manually edit your "Source/Extras/KirbyHatEX.asm" file (as well as "Source/ProjectM/CloneEngine.asm" if you're working with a Lucario or Samus hat).

***DISCLAIMER***: *Kirby hat compatibility is currently very spotty; most characters' hats do not currently work. This is a technological limitation, thouch it's possible that compatibility will improve with future developments in the scene.*
