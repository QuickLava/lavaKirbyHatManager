Instructions:
1.) Copy your "KirbyHatEX.asm", "ft_kirby.rel" and "KirbyHat.kbx" files into this folder.
2.) Add hat entries to the included "EX_KirbyHats.txt" file.
3.) Run the program. Output should land in the "EX_KirbyHats_Output" folder.

Note: Placing this entire folder into your build's "Project+" folder will allow the program to do the following:
	- Detect and back up existing "KirbyHatEX.asm", "ft_kirby.rel", and "KirbyHat.kbx" files in your build
	- Copy the newly edited versions of the above files into their appropriate locations.
	- Detect and automatically run GCTRM.
