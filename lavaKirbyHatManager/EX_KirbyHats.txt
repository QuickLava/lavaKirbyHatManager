# Add Hat Entries to this file in the following format:
# {EX Char Fighter ID} : {Source Char Fighter ID}
# For instance, the following line...
# 	0x53 : 0x11
# ... would give EX Character 0x53 a Kirby hat based on Character 0x11
# Note: Lines starting with a hashtag ('#') or a forward slash ('/') are ignored.
# 	When you add an entry, make sure it doesn't have one of those in front of it.
